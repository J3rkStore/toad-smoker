## Description

This is a weather app that allows you to search for a city and then it gives you a 5 day forcast on the temp, humidity, and wind speed.  It was built by making API calls to the openweather api


## Installation
Go to https://j3rkstore.github.io/toad-smoker/ and try it out

## Usage
  
  type in a city name, state, and country code.  You can type just the city name if you want, but it can reduce accuracy especially if there are multiple cities with that name.  Your history won't show up until you refresh the page.  "clear local data" will also remove the history buttons.  "clear line items" will wipe out the displayed weather data
